daemon.json not working
yum-cron not working maybe due to FIPS, but FIPS is not enabled
database schema not fully up to date

Password policies can be inforced via guacamole.properties file.  Not sure how to use this file in Docker container.  See reference here:
https://guacamole.incubator.apache.org/doc/gug/jdbc-auth.html
Looks like I have already made GUACHOME external to the container (GUACAMOLE_HOME=/opt/extra/guachome) so I can place a properteies file there, and restart docker.
